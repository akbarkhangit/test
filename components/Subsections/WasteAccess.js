          In Portland, it is illegal to dispose of one's household waste in private or public garbage cans and dumpsters. Without facilities or services for legally disposing of their waste, many homeless residents struggle to manage their waste. The ability and desire to maintain clean spaces is undermined by frequent sweeps, which are often driven by public One Point of Contact complaints over cleanliness concerns. While the general population attributes trash on the streets as generated by houseless camps,
<strong> according to Metro RID, 78% of illegal waste in the region is dumped on the streets by housed residents</strong>

          Such an option would be best devised and implemented with the participation of people experiencing homelessness. A broader initiative to provide training and low barrier work opportunities for can and bottle recyclers is already in the works, and slated to begin in the spring of 2019 with Trash for Peace. With additional support, this initiative could also work to devise income-generation opportunities for peer-run waste management services within the houseless community
