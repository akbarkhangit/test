          The City of Portland increased evictions on properties under its jurisdiction to a peak of 311 in October 2017. By 2018, the number of sweeps is more constant, with at an average of 42 campsites swept per week in 2018 (January-November, at the time of writing). According to an estimate from the public campsite reports, the average number of campers involved in a single eviction is 4 residents per site. Using this data we estimate that

          In addition to Portland's OPC eviction rate, the Oregon Department of Transportation has been carrying out its own campsite evictions which are not included in this data, and the City regularly counts dozens of clustered encampments in a park or along a bike trail as a single sweep-eviction. Based on this we believe

          <strong>the true number of people evicted on a weekly basis is far higher</strong>
          {' '}
          than what we can discern from the data available to us.
